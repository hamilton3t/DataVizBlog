    "title": "Global Alcohol Consumption",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction:\nI am curious how alcohol consumption varies globally and which types of alcohol are more prevalent in certain countries. I chose a data set from 2018 on global alcohol consumption with 193 observations of 5 variables. In addition to a ‘country’ variable, there are variables corresponding to annual servings (per capita) of beer, wine, spirits, and pure alcohol. First, I will look into the total alcohol consumption for each country, and visualize this on a world map. Next, I’ll investigate the top-consuming countries of the different types of alcohol. The data set can be found here: https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2018/2018-06-26/week13_alcohol_global.csv.\n\n\nPart 1:\n\nworld_df &lt;- ggplot2::map_data(\"world\")\n\n\nglobal_alc &lt;- global_alc |&gt; mutate(country = fct_recode(country, \n                                                        \"Russia\" = \"Russian Federation\",\n                                                        \"UK\" = \"United Kingdom\",\n                                                        \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\" = \"DR Congo\",\n                                                        \"Ivory Coast\" = \"Cote d'Ivoire\"))\nworld_alc &lt;- left_join(world_df, global_alc, by = c(\"region\" = \"country\"))\n\n\nworld_alc &lt;- world_alc |&gt; \n  mutate(total_consumption = beer_servings + wine_servings + spirit_servings)\n\n\nggplot(data = world_alc, aes(x = long, y = lat, group = group)) +\n  geom_polygon(aes(fill = total_consumption), color = \"black\", linewidth = 0.1) +\n  coord_map(projection = \"mercator\", xlim = c(-180, 180)) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Alcohol (servings)\") +\n  labs(title = \"Global Alcohol Consumption by Country\",\n       x = \"Longitude\",\n       y = \"Latitude\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\nThis visualization shows global alcohol consumption by country. The variable ‘total_consumption’ accounts for the sum of each country’s beer, wine, and spirit consumption. With a sequential color scale, we are easily able to see the different levels of alcohol consumption. According to the visualization, Russia and several European countries consume the most alcohol, while the Middle East and Africa consume the least amount.\n\n\nPart 2:\n\n\nThe Top 5 Consuming Countries of Wine, Beer, Spirits, and Pure Alcohol:\n\nwine_df &lt;- global_alc |&gt;\n  group_by(country) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(wine_servings)) |&gt;\n  select(country, wine_servings) |&gt;\n  head(5)\n\n\nbeer_df &lt;- global_alc |&gt;\n  group_by(country) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(beer_servings)) |&gt;\n  select(country, beer_servings) |&gt;\n  head(5)\n\n\nspirit_df &lt;- global_alc |&gt;\n  group_by(country) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(spirit_servings)) |&gt;\n  select(country, spirit_servings) |&gt;\n  head(5)\n\n\npurealc_df &lt;- global_alc |&gt;\n  group_by(country) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_litres_of_pure_alcohol)) |&gt;\n  select(country, total_litres_of_pure_alcohol) |&gt;\n  head(5)\n\n\nkable(wine_df,\n      caption = \"Top 5 Countries: Wine Consumption\",\n      col.names = c(\"Country\", \"Wine Servings\"))\n\n\nTop 5 Countries: Wine Consumption\n\n\nCountry\nWine Servings\n\n\n\n\nFrance\n370\n\n\nPortugal\n339\n\n\nAndorra\n312\n\n\nSwitzerland\n280\n\n\nDenmark\n278\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above table shows the top 5 wine-consuming countries based on annual servings. France is the top consumer with 370 servings per year (per capita). All of these countries are located in Western Europe, which is not surprising given this region’s reputation for high quality wine.\n\nkable(beer_df,\n      caption = \"Top 5 Countries: Beer Consumption\",\n      col.names = c(\"Country\", \"Beer Servings\"))\n\n\nTop 5 Countries: Beer Consumption\n\n\nCountry\nBeer Servings\n\n\n\n\nNamibia\n376\n\n\nCzech Republic\n361\n\n\nGabon\n347\n\n\nGermany\n346\n\n\nLithuania\n343\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above table shows the top 5 beer-consuming countries based on annual servings. Namibia is the top consumer with 376 servings per year (per capita). There are also several European countries in the top 5, including Germany.\n\nkable(spirit_df,\n      caption = \"Top 5 Countries: Spirit Consumption\",\n      col.names = c(\"Country\", \"Spirit Servings\"))\n\n\nTop 5 Countries: Spirit Consumption\n\n\nCountry\nSpirit Servings\n\n\n\n\nGrenada\n438\n\n\nBelarus\n373\n\n\nHaiti\n326\n\n\nRussia\n326\n\n\nSt. Lucia\n315\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above table shows the top 5 spirit-consuming countries based on annual servings. Grenada is the top consumer with 438 servings per year (per capita), 65 servings more than Belarus in second place. Three of these countries are Caribbean, and the other two are Belarus and Russia. Vodka is culturally significant and very popular in both Russia and Belarus, so it is fitting to see them in the top 5 of spirit consumption.\n\nkable(purealc_df,\n      caption = \"Top 5 Countries: Pure Alcohol Consumption\",\n      col.names = c(\"Country\", \"Pure Alcohol (litres)\"))\n\n\nTop 5 Countries: Pure Alcohol Consumption\n\n\nCountry\nPure Alcohol (litres)\n\n\n\n\nBelarus\n14.4\n\n\nLithuania\n12.9\n\n\nAndorra\n12.4\n\n\nGrenada\n11.9\n\n\nCzech Republic\n11.8\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above table shows the top 5 pure alcohol-consuming countries based on total litres. Belarus is the top consumer with 14.4 litres per year (per capita). In 2010, Belarus consumed 17.5 litres of pure alcohol per capita. Although their consumption has decreased, they still remain the top consumer in this particular year.\n\n\nConclusion:\nI was eager to analyze this data and I’m content with what I found. Given that this data covers only 1 year, you can’t look at certain trends; for example, wine consumption in France over a 10 year span. Also, there are some missing values or zero values which can provide some inaccuracy. I would like to look at data similar to this with a larger time horizon, which would allow for more in-depth analysis.\n\n\nConnection to class:\nThe world map visualization is effective because I’m working with a “global” data set. It’s interesting to look at quantitative variables on a world map, especially with a sequential color scale (when it’s appropriate). As soon as I found this data set, I thought of the map example we did in class with “well-being” mapped globally. However, for looking at the top 5 consuming countries of the different types of alcohol, I believe a simple table is more appropriate. In this case, even a table works more effectively than a bar chart or similar visualization."

    "text": "Introduction:\nI chose a data set from 2017 with data on US ski resorts. There are 364 observations and 16 variables ranging from vertical drop, elevation (base and summit), lifts, runs, acres, and more. I will be looking into difficulty level, that is, which ski resorts have the highest percentage of black-diamond trails. I will also investigate vertical drop, and the states with the most ski resorts.

Some states are gray, indicating there are no ski resorts. The sequential color scale allows us to see the states with higher numbers of ski resorts. New York, Michigan, Colorado, and Pennsylvania stand out as the states with the most ski resorts. Despite having access to skiing in many states, the number of resorts varies, and the size of the resorts varies as well. Even though Pennsylvania has a lot of ski resorts, on average they’re significantly smaller than ski resorts in a state like Colorado.\n\nnumres_df &lt;- us_ski |&gt;\n  group_by(state) |&gt;\n  summarise(num_resorts = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(num_resorts)) |&gt;\n  slice(1:6)\n\nkable(numres_df,\n      caption = \"Top 6 States: Number of SKi Resorts\",\n      col.names = c(\"State\", \"Number of Resorts\"))\n\n\nTop 6 States: Number of SKi Resorts\n\n\nState\nNumber of Resorts\n\n\n\n\nNew York\n34\n\n\nMichigan\n32\n\n\nColorado\n24\n\n\nPennsylvania\n23\n\n\nWisconsin\n22\n\n\nCalifornia\n18\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above table summarizes the top 6 states with the most ski resorts.

Since every ski trail has a rating: green (easy), blue (intermediate), and black (expert), we can look at the ski resorts with highest percentage of black diamond trails. In this case, Silverton (Colorado) is 100% black diamond, followed by Mount Bohemia (Michigan) at 93%, and Mt. Ashland (Oregon) at 75%. The rest of the top 10 has about 50% black diamond trails. We do have to consider that there is not a “baseline” scale in rating a trail’s difficulty, so there is likely some level of inaccuracy here.\n\nggplot(data = us_ski, aes(x = summit, y = vertical)) +\n  geom_point(size = 0.9) +\n  geom_smooth(color = \"blue4\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Relationship between Vertical Drop and Summit Elevation\",\n       x = \"Summit Elevation (ft)\",\n       y = \"Vertical Drop (ft)\")\n\nWarning: Removed 30 rows containing non-finite values (`stat_smooth()`).\n\n\nWarning: Removed 30 rows containing missing values (`geom_point()`).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above graph show the relationship between vertical drop and summit elevation of a ski resort. There is not constant variance; however, the smoothed line shows the overall trend. We can see that the ski resorts with higher summit elevation are more likely to have more vertical drop.\n\nvert_df &lt;- us_ski |&gt;\n  group_by(resort) |&gt;\n  summarise(total_vert = sum(vertical)) |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(total_vert)) |&gt;\n  slice(1:15)\n\nkable(vert_df,\n      caption = \"Top 15 Ski Resorts: Vertical Drop\",\n      col.names = c(\"Ski Resort\", \"Vertical Drop (ft)\"))\n\n\nTop 15 Ski Resorts: Vertical Drop\n\n\nSki Resort\nVertical Drop (ft)\n\n\n\n\nTelluride\n4570\n\n\nSnowmass\n4406\n\n\nBig Sky\n4350\n\n\nJackson Hole\n4139\n\n\nTimberline\n3690\n\n\nSteamboat\n3668\n\n\nAspen Highlands\n3635\n\n\nHeavenly\n3527\n\n\nCrystal Mountain\n3475\n\n\nVail\n3450\n\n\nWhiteface Mountain\n3430\n\n\nSnowbird\n3400\n\n\nSun Valley\n3400\n\n\nBreckenridge\n3398\n\n\nMt. Bachelor\n3365\n\n\n\n\n\nThe above table shows the top 15 ski resorts with the most vertical drop. Telluride (Colorado) has the most vertical at 4570 feet, followed by Snowmass (Colorado) at 4406 feet, and Big Sky (Montana) at 4350 feet. In the top 15, only one mountain is on the East Coast, Whiteface Mountain, with 3430 feet of vertical drop.\n\n\nConclusion:\nAlthough this data set is pretty extensive, it doesn’t include every ski resort in the country Other limitations include rating trail difficulty. There isn’t a “baseline” scale used to rate difficulty, so a black trail at a mountain in Michigan may be a blue in Colorado. I’ve been using the word “ski resort” to be consistent with the data set, so in this analysis the term “ski resort” is interchangeable with “ski area”. However, resorts are typically more comprehensive, developed, and are operated by large corporations. Contrarily, a ski area is more likely to be independent or community-operated with less amenities and fairer prices. In further analysis, I’d be interesting in a variable that specifies the ownership of the mountain (corporation vs. independent), and other categorical variables like region (east coast vs west coast).\n\n\nConnection to Class:\nWhen looking at the number of ski resorts in each state, a map is an effective visualization. It makes it easy to see which states don’t have ski resorts, which have the most, and perhaps comparing states in certain regions. I included a table with this data as well just to see more exact numbers."
